## The console
For this project we implemented a backend console using JSON serialization/deserialization that allows you to manage data. you can update, create, destroy and count objects.

## Unittest
For python testing we used the Unittest module, it is a powerful module that supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

## Usage
1. First of all you need to clone the repository to your machine
2. go to "console.py" location and run it using this command:

	```bash
	./console.py
